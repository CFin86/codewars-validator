# Code Wars Validator
This is a project put together during the TrueCoders Mark 3 Bootcamp. The goal of this project is to automate the following processes:

1. Checking if a student finished the CodeWars katas listed at the [learn.TrueCoders onboarding site](http://learn.truecoders.io/csharp/exercises/codewars/ "learn.truecoders.io")
2. Checking if the student achieved an appropriate score by the due date.
3. Storing that data in a SQL database to analyze for future classes.

This project will be written as a Express/Node.JS server using [ECMAScript 2015](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/). Documentation of the CodeWars API Reference can be viewed [here](https://dev.codewars.com/). The data will then be stored in a MySQL Database.

## Opportunities
1. After two full weeks of TrueCoders, I truly understand what it means to know a language. That being said, I understand ES6, but I do not know it intimately. This project will act as a whetstone to sharpen that knowledge.
2. I first "learned" SQL last summer. My goal is to use some of the tricks I have learned in the past two weeks to develop software with a greater precision.
3. I know it's possible to read information from an external file with Node.JS, however I've never attempted it.
